In software world, grep is a synonym for search. Most folks grep their way through logs, code and what not. Grep is too slow and literally we need to type a lot.
[Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) is a better replacement for grep, which solves both the problems.

### [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) is efficient
1. Typing ag is just 2 letters grep is 4 letters. That is 50% less typing.


2. Automatically skips searching in directories generated by version control system.

    ```
    grep -r --color=auto --exclude-dir={.bzr,CVS,.git,.hg,.svn} text_to_search
    ```


    With ag it is just

    ```
    ag text_to_search
    ```


3. Provides easy options to search only in certain file types

    ```
    find . -name "*.html" --exec grep "text_to_search" {} \;
    ```


    In Ag, it is just

    ```
    ag --html text_to_search
    ```

    Ag has about 80 odd file types where you can filter

### Ag is blazing fast
Below is the performance measure between grep and ag on my laptop searching for the word “libhttp-parser”
To be fair i have aliased grep to be

```
alias grep='grep -r --color=auto --exclude-dir={.bzr,CVS,.git,.hg,.svn}'
```


Ag Performance

```
$ time ag libhttp-parser
3.96s user
11.61s system
97% cpu
15.958 total

```

Grep Performance

```
$ time grep -r "libhttp-parser" .
135.29s user
29.10s system
54% cpu
5:03.01 total
```

**Result:** *Ag is 20 times faster than grep.*


For someone who is lazy and impatient like me, ag is the right tool for your searching needs.
