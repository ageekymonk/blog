My name is Ramz. My full name is probably too long enough to pronounce. I am a devOps engineer working in Sydney. I used to be a developer who did lot of Ops work. When the term devOps was invented, i thought why be a developer when i can be a devOps.

I love to code, travel, think and read, not necessarily in that order. This blog is a collection of rants on code, travel and everything else that comes to my mind.
